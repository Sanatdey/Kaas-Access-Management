## 🧩 Architecture

The application follows a **layered architecture**:

- **Controller Layer** → REST APIs for managing entities.  
- **Service Layer** → Business logic and validation.  
- **Repository Layer** → JPA repositories for database operations.  
- **Entity Layer** → Models for Users, Roles, and Permissions.  
- **Security Layer** → JWT / Role-based access validation.

## 🧰 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java 17 or newer  
- Maven 3.8+  
- Docker (optional, for container build)  
- PostgreSQL (local or remote)

### Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanatdey/Kaas-Access-Management.git
   cd Kaas-Access-Management
   ```
2. Build the application using Maven wrapper:

./mvnw clean install


Or if you have Maven installed:

mvn clean install


3. (Optional) Build the Docker image:

docker build -t kaas-access-management:latest .


4. (Optional) Run the application via Docker:

docker run --name kaas-access-mgmt -p 8080:8080 kaas-access-management:latest


5. Access the running service at http://localhost:8080 (or the configured port) and begin configuring users, roles and permissions.

## 🧪 Usage
Navigate to the HTTP API endpoints (or user interface if provided).
Create new users and assign them to roles.
Define roles with sets of permissions (e.g., “create pod”, “delete service”, “view logs”).
Audit access events and review logs to ensure compliance.
Scale the container deployment using Docker orchestration or Kubernetes as needed.

⚙️ Configuration
Application properties can be modified in:

src/main/resources/application.properties(application.yml)

| Key                          | Description                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `spring.datasource.url`      | Database URL (as env)            |
| `spring.datasource.username` | DB username  (as env)            |
| `spring.datasource.password` | DB password  (as env)            |
| `jwt.secret.key`             | JWT secret key  (as env)         |
| `server.port`                | Application port (default: 8080) |


## 🎯 Who Should Use This
